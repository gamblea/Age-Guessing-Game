This game is a Universial Windows Application made using C#, along side Microsfot Vision Face API Services. 
In order to play the game one must have a api key from Microsoft Vision API services.

The purpose of the game is to beat Microsofts API in guessing which person is older. The first one to get five right wins the game.
